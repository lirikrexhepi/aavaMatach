# Aava Match

Aava Match is a platform that uses an AI algorithm to help people find jobs that fit their skills and keep them motivated, based on the Self-Determination Theory.

## The Problem  
Job hunting is tough and time-consuming, and even if you land a role, it might not keep you motivated, potentially leading to burnout instead of growth.

## The Challenge  
We wanted to build a space where employees and companies can succeed both in numbers and in well-being.

## How Aava Match Works  
The platform gets to know each user’s personality through specific questions, then suggests jobs where they’ll likely do their best. For companies, Aava Match also provides insights on how their job listings are performing and tips for improvement based on our data.
